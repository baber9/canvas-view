5/20 - What needs to be done:

- fix background and footer bar on home page
- load database with at least 10 total artist, each having 4 records (4 art pieces)
- add navigation to view (which allows user to go back home or maybe toggle between artists [ideal])
- setup route for admin and finish admin login
    - ask TAs about login sessions
    - finish form to allow admin to post to db (data submitted by admin will need to be clean)

- finish styles to make the 'look' consistent throughout the site

- add logout to admin page

- clean up code and comment


- create presentation
